We have arrived at the time in the pregnancy when we're reading the last chapters of all the baby books, which cover the trip to the hospital, labor, and delivery.  We started to pack Jenny's hospital bag, and I'm making a list of all the food items that I need to get, so that I can survive a (hopefully not too) long labor and be at Jenny's side the whole time.
One book recommends that we prioritize our contact lists.  The author points out that only a couple of people, most likely our parents, care enough to be woken up in the middle of the night by our phone call announcing the birth.  Maybe even they would prefer that we wait.  Next, there's a somewhat larger group who would appreciate a phone call during normal waking hours.  Third is a group of people that would like to be notified by email as soon as reasonable.  Finally, there are all of those who will be content to learn of the birth when they read about it on the blog or see my facebook status change.
If you would like to be in one of the first three groups, please let me or Jenny know.  Send one of us an email, leave a comment on this post, or let us know somehow which group you would like to be in.  I'll do my best to oblige.
