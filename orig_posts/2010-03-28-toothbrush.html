Now that Elena has some teeth, she's starting to wonder about the best way to take care of them.  As we were getting ready for church today, Jenny set Elena on the bathroom counter while she brushed her teeth with our electric toothbrush.  Although we only have one electric base, Jenny and I each have our own brush that attaches to it.  Elena decided to pick up the free brush and imitate Mommy by sticking it in her mouth.  She then went one step further and started humming the exact tone that the toothbrush makes when it's turned on.

I remember that I didn't like to brush my teeth when I was a kid.  I thought that toothpaste was only good for eating.  (It's minty and sweet; what's not to like?)  In my adult years, despite reforming myself, I've paid the price (in pain and money) for that lax attitude regarding tooth care.  Maybe this is an early sign that Elena will take after Jenny, who has always practiced good oral hygiene habits.
