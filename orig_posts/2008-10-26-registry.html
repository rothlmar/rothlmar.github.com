We plan to take a trip to <a href="http://www.babiesrus.com/">Babies-Ð¯-Us</a> on Tuesday, at which we'll start registering for baby things.  With any luck, we won't have to make too many additional trips.  We've educated ourselves to a certain extent, but don't have too many strong opinions on the things we do and don't want.  We're taking Jenny's sister-in-law Karina along; they have two small boys (<a href="http://rothlbaby.wordpress.com/2008/10/12/practice/">featured previously</a>), and we're counting on her help to navigate the maze of baby items.

Please leave a comment with your suggestions on things to acquire, and things to avoid!  If there's anything you've found to be indispensable for little ones that is not commonly recommended, we would love to know.

Also, I'm particularly interested in thoughts about stollers and cribs.  Do you have any recommended brands or features?  Since we're apartment dwellers, and will probably remain so for a few more years, we need a stroller that is compact and versatile, since we won't have room for several different strollers.  As for the crib, we'll have room for a full-sized model, and we prefer a convertible style that can be used later on for a toddler bed, etc..  However, it seems like I've seen several different crib recalls recently, so I'm just a little bit worried, and would welcome any advice.
