With the onset of fall comes the realization that the holiday season is just around the corner.  There are things that we want to do during this special time of the year, and we need to prepare for them now.  We're starting to work in earnest on our annual Christmas packages, making travel plans, and drafting a list of presents for Elena.

It's also a time when we turn our thoughts to those who are in need.  This year Jenny has a unique opportunity to help in a significant way.  Every year our church congregation assembles and delivers the supplies for a complete Thanksgiving dinner, turkey included, to as many families as we can; this year our target is to make a hundred such Thanksgiving baskets.  This year Jenny was asked to head up the coordinating committee for this effort.  She's already had a couple of meetings, and it's clear that the project represents a substantial commitment of her time and effort for the next six weeks.

Making a hundred Thanksgiving baskets takes a lot of supplies.  Each one will contain:
<ul>
	<li>1 10-12 lb turkey</li>
	<li>2 boxes of Macaroni and Cheese</li>
	<li>2 cans of green beans</li>
	<li>2 boxes of stuffing</li>
	<li>2 cans of corn</li>
	<li>1 box of brownie mix</li>
	<li>1 lb of butter</li>
	<li>1 package of marshmallows</li>
	<li>1 can cranberry sauce</li>
	<li>1 can pumpkin pie filling</li>
	<li>1 wrapped pie crust</li>
	<li>1 can of sweet potatoes</li>
	<li>1 baking pan (big enough for the turkey</li>
	<li>1 laundry basket</li>
</ul>
It takes more than just the members of our local congregation to donate all the supplies; today everyone was asked to invite their friends and neighbors to contribute to the effort.  Donations can be of items, money (mostly for turkeys), or time (to assemble and deliver the baskets).  If you're a regular reader of the blog, especially one who lives nearby, and want to contribute to this project in any way, please leave a comment or contact me directly.  It would mean a lot to Jenny and me, and even more to the recipients of the baskets.

Giving to charity can be a tricky business.  It's something that we should do, and want to do--there's always a good feeling that accompanies giving freely.  But there are just enough mental and physical barriers to keep it from happening as much as it should.  How do we even know that our contributions are going to be used properly, and actually do good for those who need it, and not to waste or administrative overhead?

As I see Jenny work on this project, I gain more confidence in encouraging people to participate in this particular program.  She and her committee donate significant amounts of their time and effort so that 100 percent of donations can go directly to the recipients. They work with guidance counselors from local schools to identify the families that will receive the baskets.  Assembly and delivery takes place in a blur the Saturday before Thanksgiving, and the people that receive the baskets are truly grateful.  If you're looking for an easy way to do and feel good, to be part of a project that's big enough to be substantial but still small enough to know that your contribution is a critical part of fulfilling the project goals, this is a worthy cause.  Please contact me for more details.
