I just bought a Canon EF f/1.8 50mm lens for the new camera.  That's a lot of abbreviations and numbers, but the idea is that it's a good lens for taking indoor pictures without a flash, since it allows a lot of light to pass through.  I'm happy with it, and I'm done buying camera stuff for a while.  Except for a flash card; I still need one of those.
