Having a baby imposes a strict schedule on life, as I've realized more fully since I started to stay at home with her during the day.  Writing that sentence, I just thought back to when I was single, doing long workouts and staying up late to watch ridiculous movies on cable TV.  I much prefer the life I lead now.  Schedule and routine don't stand as opposites of freedom.  Instead, they encourage me to identify the options I have, then make choices and act decisively because I will only have limited windows of time in which to carry them out.

Today, after her morning nap and meal I used her window of wakefulness to vacuum the apartment, then gave her a bath.  Although we had been bringing her into the <a href="http://rothlbaby.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/shower-time/">shower with us</a>, that seems much easier with two parents.  On my own, I decided to return to the baby bathtub.  Elena enjoyed the experience, and only splashed me a little bit.

Yesterday afternoon, I scheduled afternoon errands during Elena's naptime.  She enjoys sleeping in her car seat, so I read and sang to her, then put her in it and we headed out.  We stopped by a nearby <a href="http://www.austinbabyonline.com/">independent baby store</a> and bought a new diaper cover.  Sadly, they didn't have any <a href="http://www.bummis.com/en/Products/covers/swimmi.html">swim diapers</a> in Elena's size.  Afterwards, we headed up the street for a rendezvous with someone who had a Pack &amp; Play for sale.  On the way home, we swung by Target to take advantage of a good diaper deal (because we still use disposables at night and on trips).

I feel good about the Pack &amp; Play, which I found on Craigslist. We got a good price on it, and it seems to have been used only lightly.  It did smell a little bit funny at first, but I think that was just the scent of someone else's house.  After airing it out on the porch last night, the odor was gone.  I put Elena down for her nap in it today.  We're getting her used to it in preparation for summer travels, when she won't always have her crib.
