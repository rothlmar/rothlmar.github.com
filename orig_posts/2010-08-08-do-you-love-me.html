One of Jenny's friends posted a link to a <a href="http://soundcloud.com/guster/do-you-love-me">new single from Guster</a> on facebook.  As soon as she clicked on it, Elena started dancing.  Elena cried whenever the music stopped--Jenny had to play it on repeat for a long time.

We're not sure which Elena likes better, the sounds or the lyrics.  She loves music and dancing, but she also likes giving hugs, which matches the <em>Do You Love Me</em> theme.  In this picture, the hug recipient is Mason, her regular play date companion.
