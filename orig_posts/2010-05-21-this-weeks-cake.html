While Jenny was at cake decorating class this week, Elena and I went for a run.  She fell asleep in the stroller, and when we got back I had to move quick to get her ready for and into bed before she woke up all the way.

At the class, they worked on a different kind of flower.  Afterwards, Jenny had a good time catching up with her friend Vivian.  Vivian's currently single and dating, so Jenny enjoyed the chance to remember that fun period of life.  When she got home, she wanted to reminisce about when we were dating, but I was caught off guard and disappointed her with my lack of response.

The cake, though, didn't disappoint in the slightest.  This evening, we had friends over for dinner and shared the cake with them.  They're still newlyweds, so I'm collecting my thoughts about when we were just married, so I can be ready for Jenny tonight.
