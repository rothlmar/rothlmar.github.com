Whenever we visit a place that had its heyday long ago, when the life of the people who lived then and there was very different than the life we lead today, I wonder about the way in which technology has progressed through history.  Why wasn't the printing press invented in Roman times?  Why wasn't electricity harnessed much earlier?  Could it have happened?  What would life have been like if one or more of these advances had come about earlier?  Would that have allowed the wealthy and powerful&ndash;those with the means to build castles and cathedrals&ndash;to gain even more wealth and power, or would there have been social upheaval, leading to a much earlier establishment of the middle class?

Skipton Castle is one of the oldest castles in this area, having been built in 1090.  Part of it is still in use as a private residence, but much of it is open for tourism.  It's close enough for an impromptu excursion, so we headed over there on a sunny Saturday morning when we didn't have any other plans.  We were in luck; there happened to be a troop of English Civil War reenactors encamped at the castle for the weekend.  On our way in, they informed us that there would be some demonstrations and exhibitions later in the morning.  Within the castle, some of the most interesting features were the giant cooking fireplace, the ancient yew tree, and the turret (called a "Princess tower" by Elena) where the effects of the English Civil War are still visible&ndash;the wall was partially deconstructed during that time and rebuilt differently afterwards.  As we looked out on the castle grounds from above, we could tell that the troops were gathering for their activities.  We hurried through the remaining rooms and out to where the reenactors were starting their demonstration.  We were standing pretty close as they lined up, pointed their guns forward, and pulled the triggers in unison.  I didn't realize how much the boom would frighten and shock Roman and Elena.  They started crying and ran towards Jenny, who guided them to the safety of the castle gift shop.  I followed them a few minutes later.  We browsed through the gift shop until it seemed like there was a break in the action, then emerged.  As we were deciding what to do next, Jenny noticed that the barrage was not quite over.  She yelled "run for the exit," and they managed to be outside the gate before the next boom.  It was still pretty frightening for the children, but Jenny's promise of treats helped them forget their fears pretty quickly.
