We spend a lot of family time together.  

We hadn't been in our house for a week when I had to go back to the US.  On short notice, someone from my team was needed to go on a business trip and I drew the short straw.  Neither Jenny nor I was thrilled with the prospect of me leaving while so many of our boxes were still packed, but lots of friends promised to help out if she and the children needed anything, and she let me go.  The work I did on the trip was rather unremarkable, but at least I was able to make the best of my free time.  At the beginning of the trip I went to church and spent the afternoon with my Dad, enjoying fresh vegetables from the garden with our dinner.  In the middle of the week, I had a very enjoyable evening out with Leisa, Sam, and Vera.  The night before I left, I even got to pick Laura up from the airport, since she was coming into town for business of her own.  I went rock climbing at a gym with a friend of mine.  I also had a rather substantial shopping list from Jenny that felt at times like a scavenger hunt&ndash;I certainly didn't plan to spend quite as long as I did flipping through the clearance rack at The Children's Place looking for somersault shorts for Elena, and if I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't have believed that two Wal-Marts would be out of stock of the one thing that Jenny asked me to get there.  During the week, it wasn't easy being away from Jenny, Elena, and Roman, but I managed to keep myself busy.  Jenny tells me that they did their best to be happy when I called, so that I would get happy vibes and be happy to come back home.  There was one part of the trip which was, without a doubt, better without children: the transoceanic flights.  Upon my arrival home, I was impressed by how much Jenny had unpacked.  I left behind a shambles of boxes and packing paper, but returned to a place that felt very much like a home.

It wasn't until my birthday that I had a chance to go on another significant solo adventure.  I had announced to Jenny that I wanted to take the day off and go on a long, challenging hike.  When she asked whether I was doing this because I needed to "find myself," I explained that I wanted to go out precisely because I already know myself; I know that I love getting outside to face a challenge, and it had been a very long time since I had done that, so that was what I thought would bring me the greatest fulfillment on my birthday.  I settled on a [twelve mile loop through the Yorkshire Dales][1] with two significant ascents.  The trail was tough from the very beginning, and as soon as it leveled off the weather turned, and I had to fight against wind-driven rain for much of the rest of the day.  The most moving sight on the trail was a memorial for a [World War II plane crash][2], erected by the lone survivor.  Immediately after that, the mud started; over the next several miles I was almost swallowed by the bog twice.  Thoroughly exhausted as I arrived, I met the most serious challenge of the day: an ascent of Great Whernside that seemed to go straight up.  Sadly, I wasn't able to enjoy any views from the peak, as the clouds had descended and I was barely able to see the trail five feet in front of me.  I escaped the cloud cover early in the descent, and was able to see the beautiful Dales laid out before me with the beautiful village of Kettlewell in a valley not too far ahead, a welcome sight because that was where I had left my car.  Back at home, Jenny and Roman were putting the finishing touches on a beautiful *Angry Birds* birthday cake.  I cleaned myself up, and we had a wonderful birthday dinner followed by opening some great presents.  Roman's present for me was a bag of Cheetos, but he was rather indignant that I didn't want to open it up and share the snacks right that second.
