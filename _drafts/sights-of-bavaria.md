Jenny already wrote about the main part of our [summer trip to Germany](http://blog.rothlbaby.com/2013/09/27/have-kids-will-travel.html), but we also had adventures on the way there and the way back.  After looking at the map and considering our options, we knew that there was one place we definitely wanted to visit: Neuschwanstein Castle; even though it is two hours away from Stuttgart, we couldn't be sure that we would ever have another reason be that close.
