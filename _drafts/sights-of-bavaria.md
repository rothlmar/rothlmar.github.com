Jenny already wrote about the main part of our [summer trip to Germany](http://blog.rothlbaby.com/2013/09/27/have-kids-will-travel.html), but the road there and back had its share of adventures.  After looking at the map and considering options, we decided that we absolutely had to visit Neuschwanstein Castle, the stunning hilltop dwelling of King Ludwig II, perhaps best known now as the inspiration for the Sleeping Beaut castle at Disneyland.  In the planning stage it all seemed reasonable: take the overnight ferry to Belgium, start driving in the morning and arrive in late afternoon, given the eight and a half hours of driving promised by Google Maps.  What could possibly go wrong?

As it turns out, an accumulation of little things led to us speeding down an Autobahn late at night, afraid that we wouldn't make it to our hotel before the reception closed for the night.  That, and the fact that what we considered speeding was probably considered a slightly slower than acceptable speed by most of the other drivers on the road.  It all started when we drove off the ferry, not quite as early as we would have liked, but still to early to find breakfast anywhere near the port&ndash;even though we tried.
