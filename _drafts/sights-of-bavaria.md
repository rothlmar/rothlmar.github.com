Jenny already wrote about the main part of our [summer trip to Germany](http://blog.rothlbaby.com/2013/09/27/have-kids-will-travel.html), but the road there and back had its share of adventures.  After looking at the map and considering options, we decided that we absolutely had to visit Neuschwanstein Castle, the stunning hilltop dwelling of King Ludwig II, perhaps best known now as the inspiration for the Sleeping Beaut castle at Disneyland.  In the planning stage it all seemed reasonable: take the overnight ferry to Belgium, start driving in the morning and arrive in late afternoon, given the eight and a half hours of driving promised by Google Maps.  What could possibly go wrong?

As it turns out, an accumulation of little things led to us speeding down an Autobahn in the fading light, afraid that we wouldn't make it to our hotel before the reception closed for the night.  That, and the fact that what we considered speeding was probably considered a slower than acceptable speed by most of the other drivers on the road.  It all started when we drove off the ferry, not quite as early as we would have liked, but still too early to find breakfast anywhere near the port&ndash;even though I had looked up a place ahead of time&ndash;and ended up eating from the back-up supplies that Jenny had packed.  We got reaccustomed to driving on the right side of the road, and managed not too make too many bad turns before making the next critical decision: lunch in Luxembourg, City, even though it wasn't along the shortest route.

From the small amount that we saw of it, Luxembourg seemed like a very nice place.  Even though we ended up eating at a burger joint, the central shopping and dining area had lots of nice restaurants and cafes.  Elena and Roman had fun dancing to the live music from the bandstand on the squre.  We got to see some pieces from a Elephant Parade public art exhibition/charity fundraiser.  It was also the first time we saw street performers doing a levitation act, which was incredible if only for its novelty.  After lunch, we fulfilled our promise to let Elena and Roman enjoy the amazing pirate ship playground we had spotted on our way into town.
