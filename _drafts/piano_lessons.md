Elena has always loved music and showed an interest in the piano.  During the summer months, I asked one of our friends who teaches piano lessons about Elena starting lessons.  She recommended not paying for lessons at that point with Elena, as a four year old just really needs someone to sit with her everyday and help her practice.  After ordering the recommended book for young piano students(http://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Piano-Adventure-Lesson-Pre-Reading/dp/1616776196/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1396046010&sr=8-4&keywords=piano+adventures), I was excited to start introducing Elena to playing the piano.  But then we went on holiday for 10 days to Germany.  And then school started and it took awhile to get into our routine.  And then I was pregnant and was **exhausted** all the time.  So, when Elena turned five in February, I decided to renew my commitment to teaching her some basic piano.  We *try* to sit down for 20 minutes about five times a week; working on correct posture, playing keys with the tips of her fingers, learning the difference between piano and forte, and trying to keep it positive and fun.  The beginning piano book came with a CD that I loaded onto my phone and as we talk about each new lesson there is a song to listen to as well, which she loves.  Some lessons we review several times and others we move through quickly, but overall it has been going great!  I want to help her establish a pattern of practicing and 
understand that it will require work to learn to play, but I also want her to 
enjoy it.

Should we add in how Roman likes to dance around to the music and begs to learn as well?
