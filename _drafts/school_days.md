Christmas Singing:
At Christmas time, the reception children worked for several weeks learning some holiday songs.  Elena would come home and sing them for us during dinner.  The week before Christmas break the two reception classes, along with the preschool kids put on a concert for the parents.

Field Trip
In February Elena's class had the opportunity to visit the fire station.  I was able to volunteer when one of our friends agreed to watch Roman for me (sadly, he was too young to tag along).  Elena loved listening to all the information the fireman told the children about the truck and she especially like getting to climb up and sit in the fire engine

Park Party
At the end of January one of Roman's friends turned two.  He had a little celebration at one of the parks in town where the kids ate cupcakes, played a bit and then went to story time at a library associated with the park.  It was a cold day, so everyone was bundled up-but that didn't stop the fun!  Roman insisted on putting his mittens on to eat his cupcake only and then they came back off again.

Baseball Hat
Roman and I spend a significant portion of our week walking back and forth to take Elena to school and pick her up.  He is allowed to bring a toy or two as long as: 1)it's not a ball (which I always end up chasing and crawling under cars to retrieve) and 2) he carries the toy there and back, even if he gets tired of playing with it.  This has worked out well and helps to add variety to our walks for him.  A couple weeks ago, Roman found his red baseball hat that had been missing, and forgotten about for quite awhile.  He was ecstatic!  He showed the hat to all the moms waiting in the school yard.  For the next little while that hat went everywhere with him - in the car on errands, to bed, and he asked me if he could take it in the bath.
