Since Roman's birthday party in August, Elena has been talking about her own.  On an almost weekly basis she announced to me new school friends she would like to invite.  And of course, she has waited in great anticipation as her school and church friends have celebrated their own birthdays.  So, when I told her it was time for us to start planning her party, she was ecstatic.

February in Northern England is cold, so after looking at other possibilities, we decided we could take on holding the party at our house.  I decided that 15 kids would be more then plenty to fill the house (especially considering the likelihood that many of their parents would also stay for the party).  But when it came time to make the list, there were a couple more she wanted to add.  And then we remembered we had left out some good friends, so they were also added.  In the end, we handed out 20 invitations and it was exciting to have so many friends to invite.  After the invitations were handed out and before the date of the party Elena tried to add more people.  Basically, she wanted everyone in her school class and the neighboring class (they do a lot of activities together but 40 kids is too many!) and worked different strategies to try to convince me for another wave of invitations.  Luckily, I held strong to our original 20.

On the day of the party a large sign on the front door welcomed our party guests.  Mark and I had been up late the night before setting up decorations, completing the cake, and moving things around.  The party went great!  We had someone here doing face-painting, in another room we decorated cupcakes with frosting and sprinkles, and downstairs Mark had them making and decorating paper airplanes to go through an obstacle course.  Or course, in between these activities the kids did plenty of playing and running around.  We managed to successfully gather the kids before lunch to sit still long enough to get a picture.  And then we served hotdogs, chicken nuggets, fruit cups, chips, and Capri Suns.  I had worried where I would seat everyone, but realized they would not mind sitting on the floor - which none of them did!  After lunch the kids raced up and down the stairs following the clues for a treasure hunt to find their treasure, the party bags.  We had just enough time to sing Happy Birthday and eat cake before parents started showing up and everyone headed home.  It was a great morning and we had lots of fun, but I was exhausted by the time everyone left!
