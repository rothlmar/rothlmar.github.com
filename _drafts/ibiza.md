For the fall half-term break, we wanted to go someplace sunny, to load up on Vitamin D and memories of the sand and the surf as a defense against the long, dark winter that was just beginning.  Jenny found a deal on a flight to Ibiza, a Mediterranean island off the south coast of Spain.  It's best known for wild nightlife, but we were pretty sure we would be able to find activities to suit our schedule and interests.  As soon as we landed at the aiport and stepped out into the warm air and palm trees, we knew it would be a good trip.

We had rented an apartment all the way across the island from the airport, but it was only an hour's drive, even with the hilly, windy roads as we approached the northern coast.  From the balcony of the apartment, we had a great view of the beautiful beach below.  Elena and Roman could hardly wait to put on their swimsuits and get out there.  We bought some buckets and shovels on the short walk down there, and in the process came to realize that the season was just about over, and most of the shops and restaurants in the area would be closing for the winter during our stay.  They may have removed all the lounge chairs from the beach and taken the glass-bottomed boats out of the inlet by the last day of our visit, but we didn't need those things anyway.  Elena and Roman had so much fun.  They couldn't get enough of running in and out of the water, building sand castles, dumping sand in the water, running in and out of the water some more, getting sand everywhere.  

Even though the beach by our hotel probably would have been enough to hold Elena's and Roman's attention for the whole week, Jenny and I wanted to get out and explore the rest of the island.  We spent one afternoon exploring the fortress walls and alleyways the ancient Dalt Vila (high town) in Ibiza Town, imagining what it would have been like to have lived there centuries ago.  Another day, we ventured to Ibiza's second city, Sant Antoni, where we walked along the pier and watched the ferry set off for the mainland before turning into town, wandering through streets that seemed deserted, but would clearly have been pulsing with energy every night during the summer.  Another day we visited the hippy market outside of Santa Eularia, where we bought a painting as a souvenir.  That evening, we ventured into the town and found a place that seemed to be less affected by the seasonal changes we had observed elsewhere.
