<p>It was a good thing that Jenny requested blueberry muffins for breakfast on my vacation day, because we forgot to run the dishwasher and were almost out of silverware.  Elena was a big help, but mostly she liked cleaning up the batter.</p>
<p>The previous evening, Elena helped us bake snickerdoodles for a Memorial Day picnic.  I didn't get any photos; my hands were too sugary--Jenny made the dough, then I rolled it into balls and helped Elena coat them in cinnamon sugar.  She liked shaking the sugar bowl more than rolling the dough around.  Our cookies were a mere sideshow at the desert picnic.  A cupcake contest took center stage--there were some serious entries.
