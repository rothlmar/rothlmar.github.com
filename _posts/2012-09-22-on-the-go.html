<p>My <a href="http://rothlbaby.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/prospect-of-rain/" title="Prospect ofÂ Rain">worry</a> that a cold, rainy autumn was just around the corner didn't come to fruition.  If anything, the rate of our family adventures has increased since I wrote that.  Here's a brief summary of what we've been up to since then, to be followed with additional details in separate posts:</p>

<p>We took one-year-old photos of Roman at Fountains Abbey, the ruins of a medieval monastery.  Elena made a chocolate lollipop in the historic city of York, where we also toured York Minster, walked the ancient city wall, and saw the Wizard Express train engine from the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies at the National Railway Museum.</p>

<p>We made a trip to Cornwall in the southwest.  I went down a few days before Jenny and the kids and enjoyed my time alone by exploring sections of the <a href="http://www.southwestcoastpath.com">South West Coast Path</a>.  Once they joined me, we traveled to Penzance, stopping along the way to watch the <a href="http://www.tourofbritain.com/_ns_race/default.asp?section=stage7_route">Tour of Britain</a> as the cyclists raced through Devon.</p>

<p>Our return trip included a stop at Stonehenge as we were on our way to London.  In London, we toured Buckingham Palace, did some window shopping along Jermyn Street and Savile Row and real shopping in the open air markets of Piccadilly and Camden Town, and visited the <a href="https://www.lds.org/church/temples/london-england?lang=eng">London Temple</a>.  The final leg of our trip home included one last stop at <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/woolsthorpe-manor/">Woolsthorpe Manor</a>, the place where Isaac Newton was born and grew up.</p>
