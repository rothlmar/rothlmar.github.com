 Somehow or another, I was wasting time on the internet and decided to look for a better answer to the question that many people ask when they hear my last name: am I related to Pittsburgh quarterback Ben?  I usually make a dumb joke or point out the slight difference in the spelling of the name.  Depending on how captive my audience is, I might then continue with a discussion about the transliteration of dipthongs.

 After just a few minutes of searching I discovered

  articles
 </a>
 about a trip that Big Ben took to Switzerland in 2006, and in one of them I found the name of his ancestral hometown, as well as the approximate year that his ancestors emigrated to America.
</p>
<p>
 My next step was to log into my account at
 <a href="http://new.familysearch.org">
  FamilySearch
 </a>
 and check my own ancestry.  Thanks to hard working people who have done the research and entered all the information, I found my ancestral hometown and the names of my ancestors who emigrated to the States.  Then I took a trip over to
 <a href="http://www.swissroots.org">
  swissroots
 </a>
 and entered my last name into their lookup tool.
</p>
<p>
 I discovered that Ben and I come from different towns.  My ancestors lived in Langnau im Emmental and the records I checked show that they were there as far back as the early 1500s.  He comes from Lauperswil, which is only a few miles away, so there might have been some connection.  But the waters are muddied by this fact: the two families had different coats of arms, so they might have been entirely unrelated.  I'll need to do more research to figure out the rest of the story.

 I know you might accuse me of burying the lede in that last paragraph, so let me just repeat it here: as part of my investigation, I found my family's official coat of arms.  I remember going through a heraldry-geek phase in middle school, and I must not have grow nout of it, because I think that this is unbelievably cool.  Whether you agree or not, here it is:

<p>
 My new goal is to find some way to use this for real.  Custom stationery, perhaps?
