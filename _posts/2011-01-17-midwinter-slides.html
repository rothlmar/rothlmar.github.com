<p>On Saturday Elena and I went on a daddy-daughter outing to the park.  There was still snow on the ground and ice at the bottom of the slides, which I was able to clear off so that Elena could go down them.  It was good that she wasn't wearing her good pants, because they were pretty wet and dirty when we got back.  She wanted to try all the slides, show some one year old twins how to use the slides, go spend time on the swings, and then get right back to the slides.</p>
<p>Her love affair with playgrounds in general and slides in particular goes back almost a year, as chronicled in the second of our year in review videos:</p>
