Yesterday morning, all of a sudden, Jenny grabbed my hand and put it on her tummy.  After a couple of seconds, I felt a little of what she was feeling--a little dimpling movement, just once or twice.  Sunflower was definitely kicking around, and we could feel it.  This was the first time that I felt her, even though Jenny has had some other moments, and we had already seen her moving on the ultrasound.  I should post some more of those videos.

As an aside, please don't touch the belly of any pregnant woman unless invited!  We've been warned that as it becomes more noticeable that Jenny's pregnant, random people will want to touch her stomach.  We're thinking about having her work on some tummy defense maneuvers.
