<p>Hi, it's Mark.  The default title for this post is an inside joke for computer programmers: whenever you learn a new computer language, in order to get just a little bit of a feel for the syntax and structure of the language, your first program is just supposed to print "Hello World" on the screen.  This is my first attempt at blogging, so it's very appropriate.</p>

<p>Here's a look at someone who isn't quite ready to say "Hello world!" yet, but we're starting to say hello to her:
