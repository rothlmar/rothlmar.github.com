</div><p>Even though Elena turned eighteen months old today, that was not the biggest event in our family, because today I defended my doctoral dissertation.  I was pretty nervous going into it, but confident that my results were correct and substantial enough to be approved, so that eased my worries.  I also received lots of encouraging emails in the last day or two, which also boosted my spirits.</p>
<p>All things considered, my talk went very well.  I appreciated the moral support of the few courageous friends and colleagues who were able to attend.  The slides only had a few small errors, which committee members pointed out but didn't complain about.  At the end, I fielded one or two questions, but didn't get grilled.  The committee deliberation was short, and my advisor came out with congratulations.  Most importantly, they all signed the necessary paperwork.</p>

Elena was wearing a new Texas Longhorn shirt, and they brought cupcakes.  Little did we know that my friend Ben had ordered a custom cake with my picture on it!  We had some of that and left the cupcakes as a celebratory offering for the students and  staff of the department.  </p>
<p>Even though it was early, I was ready to come home with Jenny and Elena. Jenny surprised me with presents: a burnt orange water bottle and a metallic <a href="http://www.suepatrick.com/gifts/collegiate/lhvss.html">Bevo magnet</a> for my car.  These decals are ubiquitous around here, but I imagine that it will be more distinctive in our new home.  With the defense done, we're one big step closer to making the move!</p>
