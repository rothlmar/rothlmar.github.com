 Elena had a very nice day with Martin and Christine yesterday, and it seems like they had a nice day with her as well.  I hope that everything else goes just as smoothly.  Elena spent this morning with someone else, as Christine was not available, but I didn't get any phone calls, so I assume everything worked out well.  Tomorrow, Elena has her four month checkup, so be on the lookout for a full report.

 To celebrate good times, here are some pictures of Elena wearing the dress that Grandma Nancy gave us as a gift for her at Christmas--it comes all the way from France, where Grandma had to brave language barriers and differences in shopping culture in order to figure out how to get something that was just right.  With some help from a friendly shopkeeper, she figured it all out.  Elena is very happy to wear French baby couture.
