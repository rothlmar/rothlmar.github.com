<p>The famous Texas bluebonnets are in full bloom.  Due to the recent weather, the wildflowers are especially beautiful right now, so we knew that we had to find a patch of them and take some pictures.  Elena already had a very busy and tiring morning (more about that soon), and we were worried that she would be too tired to smile for more pictures.  We drove and drove, looking for a suitable patch, and were just about to abandon our search when we found the perfect spot.  When we sat Elena down in the sweet smelling flowers, she perked right up for the pictures, with fantastic results.</p>
