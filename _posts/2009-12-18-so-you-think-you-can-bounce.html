<p>Last evening while Jenny was at a meeting, I turned on the television and started flipping through the channels.  Usually Elena just plays on the floor and ignores the screen, unless she's pulling herself up and slapping it after she's done with poking the DVD player and adjusting the volume on the receiver.</p>

<p>This time was different.  I happened across the season finale of <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em>, and whenever the music and dancing started, she stared at the screen and bounce-danced along in time.  When the song stopped, she clapped along with the applause.</p>

<p>Jenny says that Elena dances to any music she hears, and claps whenever she hears clapping, even if it's just in the background.  Many thanks to the Allens/Hikidas for loaning us a baby bouncy chair.  Elena really enjoys jumping around in it, and we don't have much time before she's too big, so we have to make the most use of it now.</p>
