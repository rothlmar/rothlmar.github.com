Every once in a while, I check the websites of few favorite performers, including hers, in the off chance that tour schedules will bring them close enough that we can attend a show.  The last time I did this, deep in the depths of last winter, I was amazed to find that [Dar Williams](http://www.darwilliams.com) would be performing in York, only half an hour away from us, on our anniversary.  I have been a fan of hers for a long time, ever since the beginning of college, and Jenny has been a fan since about the time we started dating.  When we were newly wed, we attended a concert of hers in Austin.  It didn't take much to convince Jenny that this was what we should do to celebrate our special day.

In Texas where we were married, at the beginning of March the short winter is already a distant memory, but here in Yorkshire the days are still short, the weather is still cold and wet, and spring is just a hope, not an imminent reality.
