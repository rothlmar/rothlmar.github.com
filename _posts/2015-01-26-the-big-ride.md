I don't remember exactly the idea hatched&mdash;it might have been as far back as when they first announced that Yorkshire would host the Grand Depart for the 2014 Tour de France, or possibly more recently, perhaps when they revealed the actual stage maps&mdash;but by the time we had big work lunch one day last spring I was committed enough to riding the full first stage that I started to look for riding partners.  To my surprise, I found two willing companions, Wendy and Joey, sitting at the very same table as me.  We agreed to do it on the Fourth of July, the day before the main event, and that was that&mdash;I knew I needed to start training for real. 

The ride between home and work is a decent commute: about nine and a half miles, uphill on average but with only one really steep bit, which means the ride home is easier and quicker than the ride in.   A good ride in would take me about 36 minutes, but I could make it home in under 30. I started riding it as often as I could manage, even though that was usually only two or three days a week.  With Jenny's support and encouragement, I added in some longer Saturday rides, first 20 miles, then 35 miles with a steep, steep hill, then 40, 50, and even 60 miles.  It was very kind of her to let me go out on my own for hours on Saturday mornings, both when she was in the final weeks of pregnancy and when Kate was a newborn, but she supported my dream ride, and so she supported the preparations.  I climbed some big hills on those long rides, steep enough that I had to get off my bike and walk at times, and always had a tremendous feeling of accomplishment when I made it to the top, no matter how long it took.  After my 60 mile ride, I was pretty sure that I would be able to complete the long ride, all 127 miles of it.
