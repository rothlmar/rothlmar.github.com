<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/regrebsilhtor/3587252821/"><img alt="" class="alignleft img-thumbnail" height="240" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3390/3587252821_40f5e358c8_m.jpg" title="pooltime" width="180"/></a>Last night we decided to introduce Elena to the swimming pool.  Our apartment complex has a pool, but there's also a city park just down the street that has a dedicated kiddie pool, so we decided to go there.  We dressed Elena in her <a href="http://bummis.com/en/Products/covers/swimmi.html">Swimmi</a> diaper and cute pink swimsuit, put on our own swimsuits, and headed out.</p>
<p>Elena didn't quite know what to make of the swimming pool, but she didn't dislike it.  Most of the time she had a slightly suspicious look on her face.  It was good for a first trip, and I think that she'll learn to love the pool as we go more often.  We did meet some very nice people who were also there with their children, including one woman who had a little girl just about a month older than Elena.</p>
