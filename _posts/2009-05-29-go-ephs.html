<p>The Williams College Women's Crew team began competition at the NCAA championships today.  We're sending them our support and best wishes in what will probably be a fierce competition.  Also, good luck to the University of Puget Sound team.  Check their progress at the <a href="http://villanovarowing.com/ncaa/">live results page</a>.</p>
