We had some excellent food and stayed up late last night playing <em>Acquire</em>, a classic board game that was new to us.  Jenny won, but I came in last.  Jenny helped Carrie decide on and start painting a flower pattern in the nursery; Carrie's due in July.  I went for a Memorial Day run this morning with Matt at the <a href="http://www.hcp4.net/mercer/">Mercer Arboretum</a>.   Sadly, we had to leave before the big Memorial Day barbeque that they were hosting.  We did get to see Matt prepare several pounds of meat for an afternoon of smoking.</p>

She continues to get closer to rolling all the way over--she can now go from her back to almost all the way on her side.  Once she makes it that far, it's just a small wobble and she'll be on her tummy.  Carrie also pulled out their exersaucer, and Elena had a good time practicing holding her head up and playing with all the activities.  She also got to know the beagles a little bit better, but the picture tells that story better than words ever could.  After that, Elena might think twice about having her tongue out all the time.</p>

<p>As with our last visit, I found a new book to read to Elena.  This time, it was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Mother-Goose-David-Davis/dp/1589803698"><em>Texas Mother Goose</em></a> by David Davis.  Here are a couple of my favorite poems from the book:</p>

<blockquote><em>Breakfast with Humpty Dumpty</em>
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the ranch cowboys and all the vaqueros
Got a big breakfast of huevos rancheros

<em>What are little Cowgirls Made Of?</em>
What are little cowgirls made of?
Bluebonnets and spring
And notes songbirds sing,
And that's what little cowgirls are made of.</blockquote>
