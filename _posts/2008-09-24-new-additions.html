<p>We're starting to get new additions to the home as we get ready for our little one.  (Jenny told me that she doesn't like "Baby Girl" as a placeholder for the real name, so I'm taking suggestions.)  Last night, Jenny went visiting teaching, and one of the sisters that she visits had a pile of books and a present for the baby.  It's a very soft lamb doll, and it includes an audio player with a variety of soothing sounds–whales in the ocean, heartbeats, etc.–to help put the baby (or Jenny) to sleep.  We love it!</p>
<p>You can't see the second new addition, but it also makes its presence known in the picture, because it is taking the picture.  I've wanted a fancy camera for a while, and found a good deal on a Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I'm pretty excited about it, and hope that I'll learn how to use it to take good pictures before February.</p>
<p>Finally, on a related note.  Several weeks ago, we received a mysterious package containing a Willow Tree figurine of a father and mother holding a baby.  We received it before news of the pregnancy was widespread, and all of the people we've asked about it deny being the sender.  We can't figure out who the anonymous gift-giver was, and would really like to thank them.  Since they must know us pretty well, I think that they'll find this blog eventually.  So if this is our only opportunity: thank you for the beautiful present!  And if the gift wasn't meant to be anonymous, please let us know, because we'd like to thank you for real.</p>
