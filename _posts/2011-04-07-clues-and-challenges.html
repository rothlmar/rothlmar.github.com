 I've been kicking an idea around for a while, and now it's ready for a wider audience.  I'd like to put on a one day competition modeled after the
 <em>
  Amazing Race
 </em>
 .  It won't be until sometime this fall, after Moonbeam comes.  At first I thought about staging it around Thanksgiving, as a way of celebrating my sister's birthday, but upon further reflection it might be better to pull it forward and hope to catch the last of the warm weather.

 This won't be just a scavenger hunt--it will be a mixture of clue hunting and challenges, mixing in as much local culture and history as possible.  I'll need a good supporting staff to help produce it, and I don't think we can handle more than about eight teams.  It should last one full day, perhaps eight to ten hours.  And unless teams want to film themselves, I'm afraid that most of the race will not be televised.

 So if you're interested, and will be in the greater Baltimore/Washington DC metro area this October and November, let me know.  Leave a comment, send an email, contact me on facebook, or give me a call.
