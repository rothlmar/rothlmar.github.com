<p>Congratulations to Elena for learning how to keep herself dry at night!  Jenny put up a sticker chart--Elena would get a sticker for each successful night, and after she had earned ten stickers she would receive a new nightgown, one that she wanted the first time she saw it in the store several weeks ago.  After only eleven days, Elena is proudly modeling her new sleepwear.  Good job, Elena!</p>
