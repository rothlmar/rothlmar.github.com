<p>For the two years that we've been married, Jenny and I have sent themed Christmas packages as presents to our various family members.  The first year, of course, our wedding was the theme, and the package featured a framed wedding-day photo of us, along with some other items.  Last year, we chose Texas as the theme.  Among other things, the packages included a Texas-shaped cookie cutter and kitchen towels with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebonnet#Texas_traditions">bluebonnet</a> pictures.  The featured gift was chocolate-covered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecan#Symbolism">pecans</a> from the <a href="http://www.berdollpecanfarm.com/">Berdoll Pecan Farm</a>, home of the tallest, flashiest, most hypnotizing electric billboard in central Texas.
We've been working on this year's gift for a while now.  Today we put things into high gear, so that the packages we have to mail will get to their destinations in time for Christmas.  We think we've picked a good theme, and hope our family members will like the contents of the packages.  I won't reveal this year's theme.  However, looking forward it's hard to imagine that next year's theme won't have something to do with Sunflower's first year.</p>
