<p>I was playing with Elena and Roman on the living room floor.  It would probably be more accurate to say that I was roughhousing with Elena while Roman rolled around on a blanket nearby.  Elena likes to wrestle--which means that she pushes me down, then I tickle her for a while before we reset and do it again.  I try to encourage her creativity and problem solving skills by not always going down on the first push, so she has to try different approaches.</p>
<p>During one short break in the action, I noticed that Roman was a lot closer than he had been before.  He had been working on rolling and squirming to move himself closer to things that he wanted.  This time it was different: he had moved farther, faster, and more directly than would be possible by rolling.  I halted Elena's next advance so we could observe Roman.  He soon showed us an army crawl, pushing up with his right hand and muscling forward with his left forearm.  A video is worth more than the hundred and eighty four words I've written so far:</p>
