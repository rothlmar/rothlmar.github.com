The [Memory Palace](https://thememorypalace.us/about/) is a podcast/radio segment that tells stories from the past about people, places, things and events that have been forgotten and deserve to be remembered by many people in our society and culture. The idea of the memory cottage is somewhat more modest; also to preserve that which is in danger of being forgotten, but is only relevant to a much smaller group of people--me, my family, and maybe a few friends.

The name of the podcast is a reference to a memory enhancement technique, also known as the [Method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci), which uses the technique of creating links between the familiar and unfamiliar to aid in recalling the latter.
