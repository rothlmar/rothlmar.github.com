 One of Jenny's friends posted a link to a
 <a href="http://soundcloud.com/guster/do-you-love-me">
  new single from Guster
 </a>
 on facebook.  As soon as she clicked on it, Elena started dancing.  Elena cried whenever the music stopped--Jenny had to play it on repeat for a long time.

 We're not sure which Elena likes better, the sounds or the lyrics.  She loves music and dancing, but she also likes giving hugs, which matches the
 <em>
  Do You Love Me
 </em>
 theme.  In this picture, the hug recipient is Mason, her regular play date companion.
