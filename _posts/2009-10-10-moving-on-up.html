<p>While Jenny was helping a friend prepare for her wedding reception this afternoon, Elena and I spent some good daddy-daugther time at home.  I fed her some pears and rice cereal, followed by a dessert of freshly-mashed banana.  Before and after, she had a lot of fun scooting around the living room, playing with whatever fell into her hands.  I thought a little bit about how fast she's growing.  Recently Jenny has told me about how they've been doing standing up practice.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening we bought a new car seat, because Elena has just about grown out of her baby bucket-style seat.  The new seat is in Jenny's trunk, waiting for me to install it.  We chose a very girly pink; Jenny decided that she didn't want a neutral color for this piece of baby gear.  I remember that almost exactly one year ago we started our first real shopping for baby gear.  Before then, we had focused on maternity clothing, but I specifically recall listening to the Texas-Oklahoma game as we drove from one consignment shop to the next.  We got our first ideas about strollers and cribs that day.  And Texas came from behind to win.</p>

<p>Plenty of people at the reception were admiring Elena; we told them that today was her eight month birthday, and she thought that the festivities were for her.  We didn't take a camera, so I'm sorry to report that I don't have a picture of Elena with the bride.</p>
