<p>A lot has happened since the last time that I wrote, so I'll just get to the point.  We're in England, and will be here for six months on another work assignment.  Everything was in storage already from our west coast adventure, so it wasn't too hard to repack our bags and get on the plane to come over here.  We did leave behind some of the extra toys that Elena and Roman had acquired in our travels.</p>

<p>Since arriving on Friday, we've walked around town several times, gone to church, made friends, and found a place to stay long-term.  We'll move there from our short-term accommodations on Saturday; then we'll just have to furnish the place.  That shouldn't be hard, as it's a small two-bedroom apartment.  We've spent a lot of time outside to make the most of the blue skies and sunshine, unusual for this region, because sunlight is supposed to make it easier to overcome jet lag.  All the walking tires Elena far past the point of whininess, but that has probably also helped her sleep at night.</p>

<p>Our trip over here was a true adventure, deserving a separate recounting, which I'll try to get to soon.  I should be spending less time commuting, so I hope to post more regularly and even write about the backlog of events from the month we were living with my parents.</p>
