I got two wonderful presents: a repaired watch and a fancy bag of Cheetos.  Even better than that, Elena gave me her first ever hand-illustrated card.

While Elena was creating that artwork, Jenny was working on a masterpiece of her own.  She started out making a Father's Day cake, but along the way discovered that it would also be Mia's birthday, so she made a bright birthday cake instead.  It tasted great, Mia really liked it, and all the other kids also thought it was cool.  It looked to me as if it was straight out of a Dr. Seuss book, especially the balloons.
