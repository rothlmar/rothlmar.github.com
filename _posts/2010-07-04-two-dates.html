We went to a Saturday morning matinee of <em>Toy Story 3</em>.  Jenny was welcome to join us, but she said she thought it would be a nice time for me to share with Elena, and she would appreciate the time to herself.  She packed up lunch for Elena and snacks for both of us, and sent us on our way.</p>
<p>One of my former rowers is a manager at the movie theater, and she happened to be on duty when we got there.  She came out to say hi, which was very nice, and then she showed us the right way to our theater.</p>

Elena was hooked from the very beginning--she loved the first action sequence.  I don't know what she thought about the abuse of toys by toddlers, but I hope she doesn't treat any toys that way.  By the end, she was a little bit restless, but I was very emotionally involved.  I was happy that we made it all the way through to see how it all turned out.</p>
<p>This weekend, Jenny and I had a date.  Many thanks to Uncle John, Aunt Karina, and cousins Warren, Gavin and Ainsley for taking Elena overnight.  She had a great time playing with them and didn't mind us leaving her at all.  She loves Warren and Gavin, and will miss them when we leave.  Jenny and I had a nice night out.  We went out to dinner, did some window shopping at a <a href="http://www.thedomainaustin.com/">fancy outdoor mall</a>, then spent the night in a hotel.  It was a nice change of pace, and a good way of celebrating the good news that I got a job!  Now all I have to do is graduate, and we're all set.</p>
