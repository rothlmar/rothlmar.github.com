<p>Yesterday, I realized that I hadn't taken any pictures of Elena in at least a week.  So while she was rolling around in the living room yesterday, I got out the camera.  In the past Elena wouldn't smile for the camera.  Infants recognize and react to faces, so putting the camera in front of mine would disrupt our engagement and take the smile of her face.  </p>
<p>This time things were different.  She looked right at the camera and smiled when I called her name or asked her to smile.  It seemed like she was mugging for the camera.  This one and the pictures in the previous post were all taken together.</p>

<p>We're still working on getting her to talk on the cell phone, but I think she'll get the hang of that soon.  She's also very motivated to learn a more efficient form of locomotion (other than rolling around), but she doesn't yet have the strength or coordination for crawling.  I'm sure she'll figure it out soon enough, and will get into all sorts of trouble.</p>
