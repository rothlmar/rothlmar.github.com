<p>Yesterday we went to the baby doctor for a check-up.  We've been very happy with Dr. Cherry.  Appropriately enough, she had cherries painted on her toenails, which Jenny pointed out.  I was more focused on something I hadn't noticed before--her lab coat had the insignia from Texas A&amp;M embroidered on it.  For those who don't pay attention to this kind of thing, the Longhorn-Aggie rivalry is as heated as any in the country.  That being said, we're sticking with Dr. Cherry, despite her suspect loyalties.</p>

<p>Our appointment was mostly uneventful, which was good.  We had just a few questions, and Dr. Cherry had good answers.  Then she checked Sunflower's heartbeat, which came through loud and clear.  According to the pregnancy calendar, it won't be long before I can hear the heartbeat just by putting my ear on Jenny's tummy.  I'm looking forward to it.</p>
