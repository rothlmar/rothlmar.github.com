<p>In some respects, this has been our first full-fledged Halloween celebration.  Elena and I carved a pumpkin as a Family Home Evening activity last week.  She helped scoop out the seeds, then chose the shapes for the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.  I added a few flourishes and details while executing the design.  Tonight we went to a little <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/regrebsilhtor/6300586607/">Halloween party</a>, then did our first real trick or treating from house to house.  Our friends had invited us to their neighborhood, so while we were driving I instructed Elena on how to be as cute as possible, with a big smile and some head bobbing.  She practiced for the rest of the drive.</p>

Is it just the distortions of memory, or is it really true, as some people claim, that there's less tricking and treating going on these days?  That would be a shame--I remember Halloween as a time when the motivation of candy acquisition engaged me imaginatively and analytically, helping me to grow in both dimensions.  During one of my prime Halloweening years, when I was probably ten or eleven years old and very into bows and arrows, I sewed my own Robin Hood costume.  I spent hours planning my route, even drawing an elaborate map of the neighborhood looking for ways to reach the most houses in the limited time before I had to be home.  I see the beginnings of my current self-image in those formative youthful expressions of personality and capability.  If not for Halloween and other things like it, would I be the same person today?</p>
