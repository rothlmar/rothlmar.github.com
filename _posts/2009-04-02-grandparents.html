<p>We were happy to see (almost all of) Elena's grandparents last weekend!  They all did a good job of holding her and playing with her; we were thankful for the helping hands.  And of course, it was good for us to see them, since they're not just her grandparents, they're also our parents.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago at rowing practice, Caroline and I were talking about parenting.  She commented: "Kids never realize how tough their parents really are; just the act of raising a baby toughens you up."  Jenny and I have more appreciation for what our parents must have gone through with us.  This weekend, I took the chance to ask my parents about what I was like when I was a baby--things I never thought about or paid attention to before, but that I notice with Elena.  Maybe some of those thoughts will make it into a future post.</p>
