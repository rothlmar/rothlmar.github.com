Before I write more about the New York trip, I want to share an email Elena sent me today.  I think that she had Jenny take the pictures:

From: Elena
To: Daddy

Dear Daddy,

Mommy was at her desk getting ready to go shopping and this is what I was doing.  I was just trying to help straighten things up.

Let me know if you need any help too.

love,
Elena

PS - Mommy had me go play in the front room, but I thought I should maybe help Jewel instead.
