<p>Before I write more about the New York trip, I want to share an email Elena sent me today.  I think that she had Jenny take the pictures:</p>

<p>From: Elena
To: Daddy</p>

<p>Dear Daddy,</p>

<p>Mommy was at her desk getting ready to go shopping and this is what I was doing.  I was just trying to help straighten things up.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need any help too.</p>

<p>love,
Elena</p>

<p>PS - Mommy had me go play in the front room, but I thought I should maybe help Jewel instead.</p>
