<p>With all my focus on recording everything that happened on our vacation, I've neglected Elena's current developments.  Here's a big one: she can now make consistent forward progress.  She employs a military-style crawl, lifting herself up on one elbow, then pushing with her leg.  She's been doing it for about a week now, and is moving faster every day.  We're waiting for her to get up on her knees and figure out how to crawl for real; then we'll be in real trouble.  She has a look in her eyes that speaks to her need for speed.</p>

<p>It's the most fun when Jenny is changing Elena into her pajamas before bed.  She flips over and tries frantically to get away by scooting across the bed, laughing all the while.  We hope to have video soon.</p>
