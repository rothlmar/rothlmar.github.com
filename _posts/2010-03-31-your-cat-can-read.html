For most of the past two years on this blog, I've shared a lot of personal stories and details about myself and my family.  It's been pointed out to me that in the future, these private matters might be found and judged harshly by possible employers.  Even further out, they might serve as a source of endless embarrassment to Elena.

After serious deliberation, I'm taking the blog in another direction.  It's going to be less personal, but hopefully still entertaining and insightful.  Starting immediately, this blog will be devoted to the Campaign for Cat Literacy (CfCL).  For years, so-called LOLcats have been promoted by misinformed websites like <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com">icanhascheezburger.com</a>.  It's time for someone to take a stand, and say that cats do know how to spell, and that doesn't make them any less funny.  Join me as we take back the internet for all of our well-educated feline friends!
