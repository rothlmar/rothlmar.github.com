We moved into our new townhouse last weekend.  Our movers did a superb job and we've been spending lots of times getting things in order.  There's still lots of work left to do, which is a partial explanation for why my last post was more than a week ago.  This evening we spent some time in the office/guest room, getting it to a livable state before our first house guest--Jenny's brother David will be staying with us tomorrow.

It's already late, so a more thorough rundown of what we've been up to will have to wait.  In the meantime, here are some pictures of our visit to Spring Meadow Farms last Wednesday.  Elena liked the pumpkins and farm animals, but especially enjoyed playing with her grandparents.
