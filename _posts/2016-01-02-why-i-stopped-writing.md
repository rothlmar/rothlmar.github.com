Last year I only published three blog posts; the year before was not much better, with a period of inactivity that spanned almost half the year, followed by occasional attempts to *catch up*, which had come to mean writing from the backlog, picking the most memorable and notable things that had happened, mostly about our various travels.  I enjoy our trips immensely and want to have a permanent written record of them.  In the past two years we have gone all over the world, have seen so many beautiful things, and had so many beautiful experiences.  I want to have a written record of what has happened, to stir our memories in the distant future.  I love the writing process, the space for reflection, but there was something about the state I had arrived at that sapped my motivation and lowered it below the necessary activation threshold, especially with other goals (e.g. working out) that had become a higher priority.

For writing to be a part of my daily routine, I need it to be therapeutic, to regenerate my strength instead of sappping it.  I need to put down in words the things that I am thinking about in the moment that I am sitting at the keyboard, instead of having to make the effort to recall and reconstruct events from my memory.  I hope that as I return to this approach, there will be times when I am pondering the events that occurred during this blog's fallow period.  I am inspired by two very different sources.   [Matthew Dicks](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist/2015/08/the_gist_storytelling_with_matthew_dicks_and_male_vocal_fry.html) recommends that aspiring storytellers spend five minutes every day trying to understand what happened that day that was part of a great story.  [Henry B. Eyring](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember) was inspired to keep a journal of the ways that he "had seen the hand of God blessing our family."  There is a difference between what I need to write, and what I want to have written.  In any frame of reference, learing to put needs ahead of wants is an important lesson.
