<p>Jenny always enjoys Fridays at work, since she can wear jeans for casual Friday.  Even though I don't follow a dress code at school, I noticed how much she looked forward to Fridays, and usually observe my own personal casual Friday by wearing jeans.  Last Friday, I sent Jenny this picture in an email:</p>
<div class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/regrebsilhtor/3545177087/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter img-thumbnail" height="240" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3545177087_09c16060ba_m.jpg" title="overalls" width="160"/></a></div>
<p>Elena borrowed the overalls from Danny the last time we visited Carrie and Matt.
Later on, when Jenny told me that she liked the picture, I told her that it was only half the story.  With just one hint (I reminded her of the day of the week), she figured it out.  When she got home, of course she wanted to take some pictures of us together.  Afterwards, she gave me a haircut, so at least now my hair is shorter than Elena's.</p>
