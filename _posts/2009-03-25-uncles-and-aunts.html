<p>Even though she hasn't met all of them yet, Elena loves her uncles and aunts and cousins.  She likes spending time with Uncle John (on mommy's side) and his family, and thanks them for the wonderful crib.  She already likes sleeping in it!</p>

She's happy that he accepted the job here and she'll get to spend good time with Aunt Emily and the boys in the upcoming year.  She is a little bit worried about keeping the two Uncle Johns straight.

Elena enjoyed wearing the cute Shamrock dress that Aunt Heidi sent for St. Patrick's day.  She's also excited for Aunt Heidi to have her baby. Elena hopes that she will get to spend some fun time with this cousin that will be the closest to her age!</p>
