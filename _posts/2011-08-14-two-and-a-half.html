 Sometime this past week Elena turned two and a half--the actual date depends on whether you count by months or days.  We couldn't ask for a better daughter.  She impresses us daily with her level of care and compassion, with how much she knows and remembers, with her ability to play with us or on her own, and with her impressive jumping and running skills.
