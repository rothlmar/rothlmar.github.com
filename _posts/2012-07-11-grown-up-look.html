<p>Roman and I had both started to look more shaggy than is generally acceptable, but the remedies were subtly different.  Throughout our marriage Jenny has been an excellent barber for me and clippers cost less than a single haircut, so she picked up a new haircut kit and gave me a great trim.</p>
<p>Understandably, she wasn't interested in doing the same for Roman.  He wiggles more than I do and his head is softer.  She asked for a recommendation from Elena's preschool teacher and got a ringing endorsement of the teacher's own father who runs a barber shop nearby.  Roman managed to make it through the whole ordeal without crying.  I don't think that the barber took off a lot of hair, but the change in Roman's appearance is remarkable to me, as can be seen in these before and after pictures:</p>
