Elena's Baby Book has some pages about current events and trends.  Jenny asked me to fill them out.  Here's what I have so far, but I appreciate any comments and suggestions.  For one thing, I don't know anything about fashion trends, and I don't even know where to look for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_in_fashion#Late_2000s_.282007_.E2.80.93_2009.29">reliable information</a> on about them on the internet.  Without further ado, here are the most important things in the world, according to Humble Bumble:
<ul>
<li><strong>President of the United States:</strong> Barack Obama</li>
<li><strong>Big news of the day:</strong> President Obama had just been inaugurated and many people were excited about that.  However, the economy was by far the biggest news: the housing and debt bubble popped in 2007 and 2009, and in 2009 the world faced the effects.  Governments tried to fix things with stimulus packages and "troubled asset relief programs."  Also, a lady gave birth to octuplets.</li>
<li><strong>Biggest toy fad:</strong> There were several recalls of toys with lead in them, and also a recession, so many people were going back to basic toys.</li>
<li><strong>Movies:</strong> <em>Wall-E</em>, <em>Coraline</em>, <em>Monsters vs. Aliens</em></li>
<li><strong>Hit songs:</strong> I'm not sure what to write here; we don't listen to much that's on the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&amp;f=The+Billboard+Hot+100">Billboard Hot 100</a>, although Jenny does like Taylor Swift's "Love Story."</li>
<li><strong>Musical groups:</strong>Coldplay, Plain White T's, but I have the same problem here as above-trying to balance recency and popularity with what we like and listen to.</li>
<li><strong>Television shows:</strong> <em>Lost</em>, <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, <em>The Office</em>, <em>The Amazing Race</em>, <em>American Idol</em>.  In this category I could list more, but I'm out of room.</li>
<li><strong>Actors and actresses:</strong> Brad Pitt, Anne Hathaway, Amy Adams, Meryl Streep, Nicolas Cage.  I don't know where this collection came from; I think I want it to be a cross section of high-profile stars who have been in very recent movies.</li>
<li><strong>Sports figures:</strong> Lance Armstrong (making a comeback), LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Colt McCoy.</li>
<li><strong>Best-selling books:</strong> <em>Twilight</em> and others by Stephenie Meyer; <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>; <em>Outliers</em> by Malcom Gladwell (needed some non-fiction); <em>Eat This, Not That</em></li>
<li><strong>Fashion trends:</strong> Got nothing.  Help me out!</li>
<li><strong>THE PRICE OF THINGS</strong>
<ul><li>Gasoline: $1.80, although it had been between $1.40 and $4.00 in 2008</li>
<li>Milk: $3.00, but ranges from $2.20 to $3.80 depending on the store.</li>
<li>Diapers: $10 per jumbo pack (about 40 size 2 diapers), when they're on sale.</li>
<li>Postage stamp: $0.42</li>
<li>Other: Mac laptops started at $999, and an iPod touch cost $229.  Daddy and Mommy spent $65 per month on cell phones and $25 for internet access.</li>
</ul></ul>

What do you think?  Let me know if anything is way off-base or requires modification.
