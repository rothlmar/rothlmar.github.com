title: Pacifier Noncomformist

<p>
 Roman loves his pacifiers.  He still uses the newborn

  Soothie
 </a>
 , a one-piece silicone model which appears to be injection molded.  Due to the fact that all of the pacifier's surfaces have a consistent hardness and texture, he is able to experiment with different ways of putting it in his mouth.  In addition to the standard way, he has the

 , the

 </em>
 , the

 , and the

 We think that the times when he really explores his pacifier, jamming it into his mouth as much as he can, are the times when his teeth are hurting him.  The abundant drool that appears at these times tends to corroborate that hypothesis.  Much like his sister, he's a late teether--nothing shows signs of poking through anytime soon, and he's already seven months old.  We hope the teeth don't cause him too much pain, but it's so hard to know.
