I had a scary adventure on my own last night, but I'll write about that in another post soon.  Tonight, we went to a chili cook-off and trunk or treat activity at church.  Elena wore her Halloween costume, and I had a great time going around to all the other babies; we looked at all their costumes and I chatted with the parents.

Of course, some of the costumes went well together.  Elena didn't really match the princesses and fairies, but she did fit well into the savannah scene.

With all the cars in such close proximity, it was easy for the kids to make multiple stops at each car.  Even though we had plenty of candy, when they came back to us after the first time, I made them do costume-related tricks: soldiers had to do an army crawl, princesses had to twirl, and I asked the werewolf to howl at the moon.  They didn't seem to mind, and the soldier-types all got to burn off some of their excess energy.  The lady next to us even saw how fun it was and adopted the idea too.
