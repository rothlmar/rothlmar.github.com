Today we took Elena to the Geneticist for the additional work that our doctor recommended at her one year appointment.  The doctor told us today that she thinks about what she does as detective work: there are lots of tiny clues, but very few smoking guns, so she couldn't make any definitive statements for us today.  For the same reason, I'm not going to write too much, since I don't want to alarm our family and friends that will read this.  

To begin with, Elena is exactly the same happy, healthy baby that she was yesterday, even if our visit to the doctor has made me suddenly nervous.  With my rational mind, I would call what I'm feeling <em>parentoia</em>.  The doctor took a very detailed medical history, then examined Elena.  She found enough little clues to make her want to follow up on several fronts.

The main things are the ones we've always known about: her weight is off the charts, her height is on the large side (but not off the charts), and her head circumference is smaller than average.  She has a prominent tongue.  The doctor doesn't think that she has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is often associated with the size and tongue, but additional tests will help to confirm.

We did pick up something new today, which may or may not have anything to do with genetics.  Elena seems to have a  bit of a speech development delay.  At her one year appointment, there was nothing out of the ordinary, but after the doctor pointed it out today, Jenny and I went through some on-line checklists and noticed some deficiencies.  The obvious suspect in this would be her tongue, but I'm not so sure, especially since she hit the targets on schedule up until a few months ago.  I have my own suspicion, but I don't want to speculate in public about it yet.

The doctor directed us to have some bloodwork done, which we took care of immediately after the appointment.  By this time we could tell that Elena was getting hungry and tired, but she was still on her best behavior.  When they called us back to the lab, she happily looked out the window while we waited for the technician.  Our technician was friendly and extremely competent, but I could still fell my heart pounding when she got ready to stick the needle in Elena's arm.  Elena, on the other hand, didn't seem to mind at all.  She was extremely calm throughout and didn't even make a sound.  She looked at the needle and tube for a little bit, then looked away unfazed.  I was very proud of her.  

Next up we have an x-ray to look at her bone development and an ultrasound to make sure that her internal organs are all the right sizes and in their proper places.  We also plan to visit a speech therapist , and when all that is done we'll check back with the geneticist.

One final note: I'm extremely grateful for Jenny, right now specifically for the fact that she's at home with Elena.  She spent a long time filling out the initial paperwork for this visit, and is scheduling all the additional work.  I'm glad that my schedule is open enough to allow me to attend the appointments, but life would be crazy if we had to worry about this while we were both working.
