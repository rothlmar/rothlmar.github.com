<p>I haven't posted anything in a few days, much less anything pregnancy related.  Although I could blame this on my travels and trying to get back into the swing of things, there may be another reason.  On the November pregnancy calendar (linked to the right), check out the 18th.  Also, I was reading in <em>What to Expect When You're Expecting</em>, and I remember a similar sentiment.  We are in the baby doldrum zone.  We have another doctor's visit on Friday, so maybe I'll have something more exciting to post then.</p>
