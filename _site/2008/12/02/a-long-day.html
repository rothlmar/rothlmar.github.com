I'm about to head to school for what will be a long day before I return home tonight.  I have class at 9:30 (I have to hurry or I'll be late!).  Then I teach this evening from 5:00-6:00, and following that I'm leading an extra review session for the UT Learning Center.  Immediately following that, I have to rush down to our hospital, because Jenny and I have our first Lamaze class tonight!  I'll miss the first little bit, but since it goes until 9:30, I will get to most of it.  We have three sessions, and this is the only one I'll be late for.  I hope Jenny doesn't feel too lonely right at the beginning.
