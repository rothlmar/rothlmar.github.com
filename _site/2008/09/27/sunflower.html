As I mentioned in <a href="http://rothlbaby.wordpress.com/2008/09/24/new-additions/">an earlier post</a>, Jenny wanted to find a better placeholder name.  I'm not sure what to call this--it's neither a <em>nom de plume</em> nor a <em>nom de guerre</em>, and I don't want to call it an alias or moniker.  We don't plan for it to carry over into nickname status once the baby is born.

I asked my brother Luke, and he suggested Sunflower.  Jenny liked it, so that's what I'll be using.  You might notice <a href="http://rothlbaby.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/the-only-child/">a previous post</a> where I already gave it a try.
