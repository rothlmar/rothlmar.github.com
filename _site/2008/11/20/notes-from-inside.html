Yesterday, I arrived home to find a note on my desk from Sunflower.  I suspect that her mother helped, because it had good grammar, spelling, and wasn't covered in amniotic fluid.  (After writing that sentence, I looked up "lolbabies" on Google and was not disappointed.)
In the note, Sunflower said that she was sad that I hadn't posted anything to her blog recently, and wondered if it was because I didn't love her.  Or something like that.  Truth is, I've been busy--I gave a talk to the Undergraduate Math Club yesterday, and spent a lot of time preparing it.  In addition, three straight weekends away from home have left my desk a mess, to say nothing of blog posts.  Finally, I've been working on our Christmas plans, both travel and gifts.

For now, here's a current picture of Jenny and Sunflower, taken last night.  (We also had a shoot for Jewel's Christmas photo.)
