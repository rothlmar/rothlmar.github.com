On Wednesday night, Jenny wanted to watch a movie, mostly because she didn't have to get up early for work the next day.  We didn't have everything that we were supposed to prepare for Thanksgiving, so she sent me to the grocery store, and told me to look for a movie at the movie-rental kiosk.  (It's a Movie Cube, not a RedBox or DVDPlay, but operates in the same way.)  These rental things work best when you know what you want, and you want a new release.  After scrolling through a couple of screens, I couldn't find anything interesting, and a line was developing behind me, so I abandoned the search.
At home, I resumed the search by connecting to <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>.  We narrowed our choices to <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> and a childhood favorite of mine, <em>Hans Christian Andersen</em>.  Jenny let me make the final decision, and I chose <em>Hans Christian Andersen</em>, because it has Danny Kaye, and I hadn't seen it in so long, and I could only half-remember the words to the math song <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchworm_(song)">"Inchworm"</a>.
To my dismay, that song had been edited out, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXi3bjKowJU">can be found on Youtube</a>.  The show is delivered over the internet, so there aren't any time constraints.  I don't know why they removed that song, along with "Copenhagen," "Thumbelina," and possibly others.  Still, it's a great movie and worth watching.  I don't think that it's possible to make a movie like this anymore; the entertainment landscape has changed.  Please correct me if you think I'm wrong, or can recommend recent movies that share the same gentle spirit.
I highly recommend other Danny Kaye movies, especially <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inspector_General_(film)">The Inspector General</a></em> (based on a play by Nikolai Gogol) and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Court_Jester">The Court Jeste</a>r</em>.  You can watch <em>Hans Christian Andersen</em> for yourself <a href="hulu.com/watch/39080/hans-christian-andersen">here</a>.
