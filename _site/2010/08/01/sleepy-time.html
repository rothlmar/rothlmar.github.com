Sometimes after we put Elena down for bed or a nap, she's not quite ready to go to sleep.  We hear muffled thumps from inside her room, and we're not exactly sure what's going on.  If we go in to check, she'll just want to come out with us, but if we don't she'll eventually settle down.  We're content to let the mystery stand.

Occasionally, she'll leave evidence of her activities.  She's now tall enough to reach over the side of the crib and grab things from the nearby bookcase.  Her favorite is a classic book--maybe it helps her to dream about what she'll be able to do once she escapes the confines of the crib.
