Classes for my spring semester have concluded--all that remains is exams.  In keeping with my personal tradition, I brought donuts and cookies for my students on Thursday for our last discussion section.  The donuts were for the early morning class, while the cookies were for everyone else.  I made the cookies Wednesday evening.  I followed the "Cowboy Cookie" recipe passed down from my mother, who got it as a wedding present.

My students said 'thank you,' but I wouldn't have expected anything else.  At the end of the day, I had some left over, and as I exited my building some random guy walking by saw me carrying the tub and said "are those cookies?"  I said yes and offered him one.  He said thanks and grabbed one.  After just one bite, he said "Can I have another one?  These are awesome!" and then turned to his friend and said "Hey, these cookies are the bomb!"  I did think that the cookies had turned out really well, and hearing some random kid confirm that made me feel good.

Now that the semester is over, I have more control over my schedule.  There's still lots of work to do, but I no longer have specific obligations that will keep me at school until after six in the evening.  I'm going to try to come home earlier to spend more quality time with Jenny and Elena, and maybe try to get back into shape.  Just yesterday I took Elena out in the jogging stroller for my first run in several months.  We didn't go very far or very fast, but it was good to be out there.  Elena did want to get out when we ran by the playground at the park, so I probably need to rethink my route.  Aside from that, we had a great time.  

Jenny was coming back from her morning run today, and got caught in a traffic jam because of a popular 5k race that went through our neighborhood.  She said that she saw lots of kids out there with their parents.  Every day Elena gains speed and stability on her feet, so maybe before long she'll be out of the stroller and running alongside, but only if I manage to find an exercise schedule that works for me.
