Elena laughed for the first time yesterday!  We were playing a peek-a-boo game, and when I pulled the burp cloth from in front of her face, she gave me one little ha-ha!
She's been working up to this for a while now, with lots of almost-laughs.  And she hasn't repeated the performance yet.  But I'm convinced that it was a genuine laugh.
