A friend of Jenny's is starting a photography business, and needed to build her portfolio.  She didn't have any baby photos, so she asked if she could do a photo shoot with Elena, then share the pictures with us (and add them to her collection of samples for potential clients).  Although Elena had a little bit of a fussy day (what top model doesn't?) and they had to take some breaks, Jenny told met that it went well.  We only have a couple of preview pictures, but I'll put up more when the photographer sends them back to us.  I think she did a great job and will be happy to recommend her work to anyone who needs some pictures taken.
