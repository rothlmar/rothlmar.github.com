Jenny and Elena left today for Houston.  They went to visit Carrie, Matt, and Danny, and meet baby Kaylee for the first time.  This may be the only time that Elena gets to see baby Kaylee for the forseeable, and while Jenny is sad about that, she's very happy for Matt and Carrie to have exciting things going on in their lives.

Of course, I miss them very much.  I'll just have to do my best to keep myself busy for the next few days.  Also, Jenny's birthday is next week.  With her out of the house, I have the chance to prepare.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to carry out all my plans, but I'll at least be able to go shopping without worrying that I'm missing valuable family time.  I've already discussed this with Jenny, so I feel all right about disclosing it on the blog: I'm going to attempt to buy some clothes for her.  Don't worry, she gave me a very specific thing to look for, and I'll keep the receipts.

Now on to the part I know you've been waiting for--here are some fresh-from-the-camera pictures of Elena.  I think she gets cuter every day.
